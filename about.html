                                <h3>About this page</h3>
								<p>Like I've previously stated the purpose of this page is to keep track of my assignments, as well as allowing my teachers (and other interested parties) to view them. When the semester is over, the plan is that this page will be full of interesting, well executed assignments for everyone to view.</p>
                                <h3>Studies</h3>
								<p>Now, I am currently finishing my Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Iceland. Here I've gathered many skills, which I am certain will prove useful in the future. As for said future, I plan on pursuing further education and in the fall will continue on my path to becoming an engineer by beginning my Master studies in Mechanical Engineering, or other similar fields.<br/>
                                The reason for continuing down this path is two fold: On the one hand I am interested in having a hand in the design of all sorts of things, creating compllex machinery, as well as having a passion for doing things in an environmentally concious manner. I believe a Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering will provide a great base for a job in one of these fields. <br/>On the other hand the afformentioned interests also pose a problem: what I want to do for a job, and that's just the thing. I don't know. Therefore I believe it to be wise to pursue becoming "a jack of all trades" as to not exclude anything yet.</p>
                                <h3>About myself</h3>
                                <p>As for myself I am currently just trying to figure out what to do with my life, parallell to my studies. One of the things I decided to do in my free time was to participate in a program called <b>"sprettur".</b> The purpose of this project is to help kids in High School, with an immigrant/refugee background find their feet in both their studies and in daily life. The end goal is then to provide them with a platform to seek further education in the form of a Universiry degree. <br/> The decision for joining the program was an easy one for me. It provided an opportunity to give back, and to explore a differend view on the country I call home, but is perhaps alien for these kids. Therefore I didn't hesitate, and do not regret it today.</p>
